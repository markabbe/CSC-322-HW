Summary: Definitely some bugs within this code and it is not working perfectly,
but the trace file tests seem to execute properly. Wish I wasn't so busy this
semester and could've allocated more time to this project, because it was very
challenging and fun.


Files:

Makefile	# Compiles your shell program and runs the tests
README		# This file
tsh.c		# The shell program that you will write and hand in
tshref		# The reference shell binary.

# The remaining files are used to test your shell
sdriver.pl	# The trace-driven shell driver
trace*.txt	# The 15 trace files that control the shell driver
tshref.out 	# Example output of the reference shell on all 15 traces

# Little C programs that are called by the trace files
myspin.c	# Takes argument <n> and spins for <n> seconds
mysplit.c	# Forks a child that spins for <n> seconds
mystop.c        # Spins for <n> seconds and sends SIGTSTP to itself
myint.c         # Spins for <n> seconds and sends SIGINT to itself
